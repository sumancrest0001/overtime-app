# Overtime App

This is a ruby on rails app designed and developer as an MVP. The main goal of this project is to allow admin of a company to add, check, and approve overtime of employees. It also helps employee to verify their overtime duration.

## Models

- Post -> date:date rationale:text
- User -> devise
- AdminUser -> STI

## Features

- Approval Workflow
- SMS sending -> link to approval or overtime input
- Administrate admin dashboard
- Email summary to managers for approval
- Needs to be documented if employee didn't log overtime.

## UI

- I am using bootstrap for most of the styling along with SASS.
